        synopsis: 'This is the story of Val and Clare: a mother and a daughter. After the tragic death of her eldest child, Val left her kids and family behind and escaped into the Colombian jungle. Only 11 at the time, Clare Weiskopf (the director of this film) couldn’t understand what her mother was looking for. Thirty years later, when she becomes pregnant, Clare decides to confront her mother, heal the wounds of the past, and try to define motherhood on her own terms. Together they go on an intimate journey exploring the boundaries between responsibility and freedom, with all the guilt and sacrifice they entail. What makes someone a good mother?',

For them, films are not only a support, but also a safe and recurrent event in the days that go by and the cinema is a place where they can ease their loneliness and forget the passage of time. Like a drop of water, fiction slaps their lives, leaving a trace on their memory.',

        // tslint:disable-next-line:max-line-length
        synopsis: 'In 1979 Nicaragua, a dictatorship that lasted decades has been overthrown and the revolutionary Sandinistas have taken over. As far as young Gloria is concerned, they are superheroes—particularly as her parents are on the front line of the coup and subsequent civil war. But the revolution takes its toll—her parents’ dedication to the cause means they have little time for their children. Years later, their adult daughter turns to the camera as she touches on painful subjects relating to her parents. This results in candid, searing discussions about torture, tragic deaths, doubt, disillusionment and parenting, which always took second place to the greater good. In a way, Heiress of the Wind is a highly personal film, with Gloria narrating her own memories in voice-over. Extensive use of archive footage also presents us with a clear historical impression of a changing Nicaragua.',

        synopsis: 'A researcher found 32 documentaries filmed on Easter Island almost a century ago. They contain images of the island’s rock sculptures, the Moai, but they barely show the is- land’s inhabitants, whom at the time were being subjected to a cruel colonization, being treated like slaves and held captive for over 60 years. Desperate, many of them escaped on makeshift boats, heading out for open sea. Solitary Land tells the story of how one of the world’s most beautiful tourist destinies was once a prison, together with a register of the island’s current prison: a small community guarded by local and Chilean prison guards, from which no inmate has ever escaped. Where would a fugitive go on the planet’s most remote island? Solitary Land is a documentary about the paradox of freedom.',

The Beyoncé phenomenon has given the city\'s young and persecuted homosexuals both a voice and a place in the limelight. And two months in an igloo tent can also be quite a party!',

        synopsis: 'Before their inevitable farewell, a young man of Mayan roots and Natan, his half Italian son, embark on an epic journey into the open sea to the Chinchorro reef off the coast of Mexico. There the son is taught to fish and snorkel, discovering the world and culture of his father’s water-bound life.\n\nThis unusual and haunting film requires some patience, as there\'s little in the way of "action", but once you get into its unique rhythms, you\'ll find a rewarding and very moving experience awaits. On Mexico\'s beautiful Caribbean coast, a fisherman is spending time with his young son before the boy returns to Italy to live with his mother. This is about more than the parenting arrangements of divorced couples, however; it\'s about keeping alive a bond when divided by distance, time or culture. It\'s a film with much of importance to say, you just have to slow down a little to hear it.',

The tragic fate of the first democratic transition in Latin America leads the filmmakers to engage in an intense exercise of storytelling that combines investigative journalism, film essay, and personal drama. To challenge the burden of silence that weights over an entire country, this documentary film sheds light on the largely unknown yet quite unexpected history of Ecuador, the Shakespearean drama of three orphans shattered by the struggle for political power, and the implacable weight of official truth.',

He hopes to find out how they think, dream and live. His simple, empathetic questions about parents and school soon elicit very candid stories. There are girls growing up without a father or mother, because their dad has disappeared and their mom is always at work. There’s a boy who is bullied and has now fallen victim to a deep sense of boredom, and a teenage girl who feels threatened by her stepfather. But there are also plenty of light-hearted moments: a tough, teenage girl who sings Roxette’s “Listen To Your Heart,” another who writes poetry and a seven-year-old who fantasizes about what the world was like before she was born. “Adolescence is just miserable, that’s why I should have filmed kids,” concludes Coutinho, who did what he did best, listen, to the very end. Last Conversations was completed after Coutinho’s death by João Moreira Salles.',
