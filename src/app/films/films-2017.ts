        title: 'SURIRE',
        synopsis: `The Surire salt flat is located in the Chilean high plateau at 4,300 meters
        over the sea level, on the border with Bolivia. In its surroundings live
        a handful of elders, the last survivors of the Aymara culture in the area.
        As background, the machinery of a mine site roams the landscape,
        intermingled with flamingos, vicunas and llamas. SURIRE is a film that from
        observation and visual language portrays this unique space in which coexist
        natural beauty, human absurdity,and cultural decline.`,

        viewer on a voyage of the senses, as it reflects on nature, communal life, solitude
        and silence... An ode to sound, that mysterious, invisible and intangible phenomenon
        that brings pleasure andtogetherness – and sometimes irritation.`,

        behind a childhood spent in hiding during the military dictatorship, and she leaves behind Petra, her
        seven-year-old sister. Two decades later, Petra goes to New York to pursue acting... and in search of
        Elena. But the film (and the filmmaker) cannot escape the similarities between Petra and Elena’s stories,
        and as they overlap, they begin to blur. In the spirit of Tarnation, ELENA obliterates the line between
        documentary, diary, and fever dream, and is at once captivating and devastating.`,
