      <h2>Who are we?</h2>
      <p>A band of documentary film aficionados who eventually drag our beloved friends into the project to help us. Some of us are from Latin America, others from Hungary. Some have PhD in documentary film and others had just recently discovered this genre. What we all have in common is the will to bring this new cultural experience to Budapest. Oh yes, thatâ€™s another thing we have in common: we all love Budapest.</p>
