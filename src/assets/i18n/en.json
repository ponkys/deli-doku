    "TITLE": "About",
    "PARAGRAPH_1": "We’re proud to present the very special 3rd edition of the Déli Doku festival. This year, more than inviting our audience to experience Latin America through documentary cinema, we want to dedicate our festival to praise and discuss the women representation in film industry.",
    "PARAGRAPH_2": "In the words of Kate Erbland: \"For as long as there have been movies, there have been women making them. When the Lumière brothers were shocking audiences with their unbelievable depiction of a running train, Alice Guy-Blaché was pioneering her own techniques in the brand-new artform. When D.W. Griffith was pioneering advances in the art, and building his own studio to make his work, Lois Weber was doing, well, the exact same thing. When Hollywood was deep in its Golden Age, Dorothy Arzner, Dorothy Davenport, Tressie Souders, and many more women were right there, making their own films. It’s not even a trend that really abated, because it was never a trend. For so long, women being filmmakers was simply part of the norm.\" For us, the Deli Doku team, this should continue to be the norm.",
    "PARAGRAPH_3": "Every year, we have a massive participation of women directors and stories from the feminine world. Now, we decided to make it official. So more than just bringing their films, we want to give them the desired recognition and praise their presence in documentary cinema, be it behind or in front of the camera. It’s about time to show women as the protagonists they really are in cinema. And what better way to do this than through documentary films?",
    "FREE_CTA": "AND DID WE MENTION THAT ALL SCREENINGS ARE FREE OF CHARGE? AND IF YOU ARE LUCKY, EVEN SOME WINE TOO!",
    "WHY": "Why we do it?",
    "WHY_REASON": "We want to bring Latin America a little closer to Budapest. And there’s not better way to do this than sharing their real stories told in a new way: the documentary cinema. More than pleasing documentary film lovers, we from the Déli Doku team want to invite new lovers to join this hub and discover the beauty of watching these real stories being told through the lenses of a camera. More importantly, we want to promote, support and elevate the documentary film industry.",
    "HOW": "How we do it?",
    "HOW_REASON": "Our crew is made of volunteers who believe in the idea of this festival and dedicate their free time to create and promote the event. The support from embassies, cultural centers and distributors is crucial, since we run all our activities basically on a zero budget. Sponsor are always welcome so if you have a business and you want to support us don’t be shy and drop us an email."

Some have PhD in documentary film and others had just recently discovered this genre. What we all have in common is the will to bring this new cultural experience to Budapest. Oh yes, that’s another thing we have in common: we all love Budapest.",
